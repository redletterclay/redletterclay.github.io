title: Tomoo Hamada @ Rebuild Foundation
description: |
 <p>Theaster Gates opened his private studio to host a Tomoo Hamada talk & workshop on Chicago's southside. Tomoo is the grandson of Shōji Hamada working out of Mashiko, Japan — a famous pottery village just north of Tokyo that his grandfather started.</p>
 <p>Tomoo spoke about his family's clay work, brought pieces to display, and gave a 4-hour demonstration of various techniques and forms. We also got to see Theaster's wood kiln next to his studio. Many thanks to Theaster and the Rebuild Foundation for opening up their doors and inviting such a talented Japanese potter to Chicago!</p>
