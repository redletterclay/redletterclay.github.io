The Mingei movement in Japan was studied by the Bauhaus school founders in its early formation. Coined by Yanagi S≈çetsu, he believed beauty could be found in ordinary and utilitarian everyday objects made by nameless craftspeople (as opposed to higher forms of art created by named artists). 

### He argued the beauty of folk crafts lay in:
- the use of natural materials and "natural" hand-made production
- traditional methods and design
- simplicity
- functionality in form and design
- plurality, meaning that folk crafts could be copied and reproduced in quantity
- inexpensiveness
- made by unknown craftspeople
- had a "beauty of health" - a healthy attitude during the manufacture of folk crafts led to healthy crafts

Here are some pieces in Tokyo's Mingei Museum. I had a great visit on my last trip to Japan.
