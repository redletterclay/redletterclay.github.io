title: Washi Paper Ceramic Lantern
description: |
 <p>Last year I attended a <a href="https://www.switchgrasspaper.com/" target="_blank">Switchgrass Paper</a> workshop at a Chicago Public Library where we made washi paper from mulberry pulp. We took the paper we made as a group and created an installation to hang in the library with it. It was a fun collaborative art making process and I highly recommend Switchgrass Paper workshops!</p>
 <p>I wanted to incorporate handmade washi paper as a shade in a ceramic lantern and designed this prototype. The uncovered holes on the side allows for air to get to the tea light and lets you pick it up and move it as the lid gets very hot. They also allow you to blow the candle out. I learned a lot from this construction and really love how the mulberry/kozo fiber shows when lit!</p>
