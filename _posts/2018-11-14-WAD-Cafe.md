### Ceramic Beginnings in Japan
My first real interaction with finely made pottery was at a tea cafe in Osaka, Japan. WAD's tea master built a relationship with local ceramic artists and featured their work in his cafe (and ceramic gallery). We had green tea 3 ways there (brewed at different temperatures, and finally served as a salad). If you are ever in Osaka, it's a great spot!

It always strikes me in Japan how handmade pottery can be found in the tiniest neighborhood cafes and shops. It is so deeply appreciated and loved culturally. One might argue it surpasses painting in the fine art world even. In the West we are so accustomed to manufactured ceramics for tableware. In fact, I don't recall ever interacting with a handmade pot until my 30's.
