 <p>Takeshi is a prolific artist, exploring the limits of wheel pottery. His technique focusing on expressing the material through stretching and pinching truly sets his work apart. He pushes what is possible on the wheel and has great glaze work using oxides referencing Tang Dynasty tri-colored glazed pottery from China.</p>
 <p>While these clips are older, they showcase his work and innovative approach to the possibilities of the wheel so beautifully.</p>
