        <h3 class="pt-3">About Me</h3>
        <p>Red Letter Clay is operated by Davey Ball. By day I'm a <a href="https://www.raygun.org" target="_blank" alt="Raygun Design">digital marketer, designer and video editor</a>.</p>
        <p>I have been in Chicago for 20 years now but didn't become involved in the <a href="https://www.gnarwareworkshop.com" target="_blank" alt="GnarWare Workshop">clay community</a> here until 2018. My interest began on the wheel but I have taken all offered classes for handbuilding, studio operations, glaze chemistry, and slipcasting.</p>
        <p>I sell at a <a href="/shop/" alt="Shop">couple stores in the Chicago area</a>, and you can find me at a few markets in-person a few times a year. Thank you for checking out my work.</p>
