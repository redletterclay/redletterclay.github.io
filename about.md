            <h3 class="pt-3">About Me</h3>
            <p>Red Letter Clay is operated by Davey Ball. By day I'm a <a href="https://www.raygun.org" target="_blank" alt="Raygun Design">digital marketer, designer and video editor</a>.</p>
            <p>I sell at a <a href="/shop/" alt="Shop">couple stores in the Chicago area</a>, and you can find me at a few markets in-person a few times a year. You can subscribe to my mailing list below for occasional updates throughout the year.</p>
            <h3 class="pt-3">Artist Statement</h3>
            <p>I was brought up in a <a href="https://www.gnarwareworkshop.com" target="_blank" alt="GnarWare Workshop">community studio</a> in Chicago, IL. I like to work with various stoneware clay bodies — often combining wheel thrown pieces with hand built techniques. I strive to create straightforward  work that focuses on the natural material beauty of clay and glaze to craft functional pots that stand alone in their stillness as sculptural objects when not in use.</p>
            <p>I want my pots to be picked up, touched, used and enjoyed. When you enjoy a well made pot you find many uses for it and develop a connection to its maker — something that I find wonderfully unique to clay as my chosen medium.</p>
