My first experience with exceptional handmade ceramics wasn't until my mid 30's, in <a href="/travel/WAD-Cafe/" alt="WAD Tea Cafe Osaka Japan">a tea cafe in Osaka, Japan</a>. Growing up in America I was accustomed to industrialized tableware - both at home and dining out.

But one-of-a-kind tableware made by hand appeals not only to the eyes but to ones tactile senses when being picked up and used.

I guess you could call me a “clay evangelist” now.

My hope as a potter is to create pieces that make your daily ceremonies more special: your morning cup of coffee, tending to your houseplants, or meals with family and friends.

It's not just potters who keep handmade ceramics alive, it's the people who use and enjoy them too.

And for that, I would like to thank <span class="fst-italic fw-lightest">you</span> for checking out my work and supporting my craft. &mdash; <a href="/about/" alt="About Davey">Davey</a>
