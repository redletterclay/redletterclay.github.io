<h2 class="text-white">Crafted, Not Manufactured</h2>
My hope as a potter is to create pieces that make your daily ceremonies more special: your morning cup of coffee, tending to your houseplants, or meals with family and friends. I believe handmade pots enrich regular activities in our lives. You develop connections with your objects through use. These moments of experiencing thoughtful intention connect us beyond what a machine or mold could provide.

It's not just potters who keep handmade ceramics alive, it's the people who use and enjoy them too. And for that, I would like to thank <span class="fst-italic fw-lightest">you</span> for checking out my work and supporting my craft. &mdash; <a href="/about/" alt="About Davey">Davey</a>
