<h2 class="text-white">From Industrial to Intentional</h2>
My first experience with exceptional handmade ceramics wasn't until my mid 30's, in <a href="/travel/WAD-Cafe/" alt="WAD Tea Cafe Osaka Japan">a tea cafe in Osaka, Japan</a>. Growing up in America I was accustomed to industrialized tableware - both at home and dining out.

But one-of-a-kind tableware made by hand appeals not only to the eyes but to ones tactile senses when being picked up and used.

I guess you could call me a "clay convert" now.

My hope as a potter is to create pieces that make your daily ceremonies more special: your morning cup of coffee, tending to your houseplants, or meals with family and friends. I believe handmade pots enrich regular activities in our lives. You develop connections with your objects through use. These moments of experiencing thoughtful intention connect us beyond what a machine or mold could provide.

It's not just potters who keep handmade ceramics alive, it's the people who use and enjoy them too. And for that, I would like to thank <span class="fst-italic fw-lightest">you</span> for checking out my work and supporting my craft. &mdash; <a href="/about/" alt="About Davey">Davey</a>
